# Code-Snippet-Generator
SpringBoot + Thymeleaf + H2 Database + Gemini API

This project is an AI-powered web application built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and an H2 database. It integrates with Google's Gemini API to generate code snippets based on user prompts. Users can input natural language descriptions of the code they need, and the application leverages the Gemini API to generate corresponding code. All generated snippets can be saved, viewed, searched, and managed within an H2 in-memory database. The user interface is designed using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap, offering a clean and professional experience for developers to quickly generate and store code examples.
